# Marbles

**WE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND AWAIT A FIRST VERSION**

Going to be open to all at some point, this is the online marbles hub. By 
typing the command 'make run' and enter, you will be able to open the 
board and play around. We are still in the progress of creating 
playability, but as of now you can play around in on the board, nothing 
more. 

## Next Steps

1. I will be including codes to find and play games with friends
2. Once we launch, there will be documentation of all games that includes 
stats of all types. 
3. While this is far down the road, I hope to add single player modes 
whenever friends aren't available to play. 

The first 2 will are just down the road and updates will be posted when 
there is a final version.
